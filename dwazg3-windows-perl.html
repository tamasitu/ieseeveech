                            <p> I have the Setup.pl perl script file, but every time I try to run this goddamn command, it fails me. This is the output I get everytime (pastebin): I've uninstalled and re-installed vCLI numerous times. Any help would be appreciated it. UPDATE : I found out that the culprit is my host system. Its a domain-member as well as heavy with network/sec policies from global IT. Quite possible that's the reason why. Could even be the locked down McAfee. Sometimes you walk into a trap of your own making. Last week, on a day I was working from home, I woke up to a Slack message from a manager, $M, sent late the previous night (note, we run Ubuntu on workstations): gt$M: Hi $me, my laptop is not allowing me to log in. Is there a backup account I can use? gt$M: I was suddenly not able to `sudo`, so I rebooted and now I cannot log in either At this point I'm thinking, hmm, `sssd`'s cache is the most likely cause, but most people I have no clue what happened, but when I try to cat /etc/hosts, all I get is a message that says nge this entry. amp#x200B; I have no idea what that means or why it's happening. Can someone please. Hi :) I would like to start to learn perl. Downloaded Active Perl but it seems the last version is a from 2017. I'm on windows. I was attracted but the functionalities of Active Perl. There is maybe another most up to date environment I can use instead of it? Or I can stay on Active perl? Thanks in advance. I got this code replace.pl: '#!/usr/bin/perl -l use strict; use warnings; print join "\n", split while ltgt;' And I run it: replace.pl myfile.txt. It makes all spaces into newline and prints it in command prompt. How can I write that info back to the myfile.txt, essentially overwriting. 
I know a lot of you probably have TecoC installed on your computers for experimentation; I've found that it's a fine line editor, far better than ed or sed. Now, I'm a big Teco fan (I used a visual Teco called SCITECO before I got into Spacemacs, because Vi was too lightweight and Emacs gave me arthritis), so much so that my eMail siggy is a quick Teco script that prints "just another teco hacker,", but this is a question for everyone. I find that line-mode Teco (like TecoC, not like SCITECO. I'm curious if it's worth the investment from a productivity and licensing standpoint. In the midst of this very interesting article about Linux kernel development and regression (https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/779997/11de2bdc8dbc0d69/), the following statement is found gt One might well wonder just how things worked before, since a truncated version of that shebang line is still wrong. It turns out that the Perl interpreter is able to detect this truncation; it rereads the first line itself and sets its arguments properly. As long as the interpreter itself is the correct. I am looking to learn scripting for work, and have been recommended Bash as a good place to start as we use it a lot here. This obviously isn't the main function of my job, but it is something I was interested in school, but didn't have a chance to get into it in any real sense. What would you folks recommend as a good starting resource, be it book, website, video series, or other I am just kinda overwhelmed looking for a good starting point. i have file.txt https://ufile.io/302ox that contains each link in a new line like this but without empty lines https://www.youtube.com/user/JustForLaughsTV https://www.youtube.com/user/collegehumor https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRix1GJvSBNDpEFY561eSzw i would like to add a suffix /videos to each line so that the output would be like this: https://www.youtube.com/user/JustForLaughsTV/videos https://www.youtube.com/use. Hi all. I'm completely new to Perl, I'm playing with the ZeroSSL LetsEncrypt script (details here: https://zerossl.com/installation.html (https://zerossl.com/installation.html)) as I needed to include a couple of custom modules to be run against it, and need to pack it so it can be distributed to some Windows machines as a standalone executable. When I use pp with the -c argument (pp -c -o le.exe le.pl (https://le.pl)) the executable seems to be created successfully. I only recently noticed that Shutter was removed from testing (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=886145) and will probably be completely removed in Buster. Are there enough people interested in keeping it that we could perhaps crowd fund its transition from using older libraries and fund its development and maintainership further ? Edit : Shutter also provides editing tools that make it very simple and quick to create good material for documentation, support I know there are many on the Microsoft side that will say PowerShell which is used for scripting among other things. I just got a position at a MSP as a technical analyst, but I would like to do some programming. I always wanted to, but just haven't found much use for it. I am interested in Python, since people say advanced networking techs use it and it's built in to Linux. 
Hi all! I'm not sure this is the place to ask this or maybe /r/mysql would be more appropriate, but since I'm using Perl, I guess some of you could be of help. ;) I've decided to ditch my hosting so I installed MySQL on my machine (Windows) and imported my database from the remote server to a local database throught the MySQL Workbench. Then I changed my script to connect to the local database instead, changing my server's address to `localhost`, like so (anonymized ofc): my $database. Sorry for the titlegore… I'm not a perl dev (am a net dev) but I have a few legacy items on the server. It's time to make things more secure and this is the last item that breaks when I turn off insecure protocols. Is use CGI::Minimal; incompatible with TLS1.2 or do I just need to change something? I'm having difficulty finding any information. Thanks. I personally have mcsa 2012 , citrix , ccna (really old now though 5+ years) ejpt from elearnsecurity and currently working on mcsa for office 365. I can not help feel i am behind everyone. We are a two man IT team who are a jack of all trades in a SMB so it is harder to see what everyone is working on in the sysadmin world right now. What should we be learning about and studying to stay current? And what would be a waste of time at this point. So I just started with i3 and liking it so far. I'm looking for a way to bounce between two windows - basically alt-tab. I've seen this post - https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1773/how-can-i-configure-i3wm-to-make-alttab-action-just-like-in-windows/%3C/p%3E.html (https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1773/how-can-i-configure-i3wm-to-make-alttab-action-just-like-in-windows/%3C/p%3E.html) but given that it's from 5 years back, is there a less hacky/more inbuilt way of doing Everytime I run the configure.cmd it says, "Cannot configure path to openSSL" and then closes. I have no clue what to do and google is not helping. amp#x200B; I have spent days trying to figure out Twitch API and Oath and I am so lost trying to understand this. I have went to the twitch discord and asked for help and they have tried but I am just getting no where. I haven' been able to make one script yet and its driving me crazy. Make a discord script is so much easier
